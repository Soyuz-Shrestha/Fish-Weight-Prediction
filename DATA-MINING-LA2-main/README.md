DataMining-LA2
Fish weight Prediction
Fish weight predictior built using python.

About the project
It is a supervised machine learning project built to predict the weight of fish based on various factors.We are using vairous data mining tasks to build a model that predicts the weight based on the factors line weight,height,length etc.
